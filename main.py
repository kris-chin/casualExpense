    Graphs the money bleeding from your wallet.
    Each recurring expense is represented as an expense object that contains a name, initial cost, and recurrance rate

    #TODO: add easy identification of amounts after certain days
    #TODO: add a way to adjust the paramaters of each expense to see how to fix your budget
